    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p class="text">
      <a class="ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo">Water Polo</a> is a water-based team sport played with 7 players from each time in the water at a time. This game is popular on the West Coast of the United States of America, most of Europe, and some parts of Asia (primarily Russia). The game is split into 4 quarters, each of equal length (length of quarters vary from different leagues). Beginning in the mid-19th century, water polo has become one of the most popular sports in the world.

    <h2> How is it played?</h2>
    <p class="text"> Water Polo, despite its many variations, is commonly played the same way. Each team has 7 people in the water at a time, 1 of which is the goalkeeper, who follows different rules than the other 6 players. The goalkeeper is allowed to use 2 hands, and go anywhere in the pool, as long as they do not cross half-court. If shallow enough, the goalkeeper may also stand and jump off of the floor of the pool. The other 6 players from each team compete to score a goal, by making it past the goalpost of the opposing team. Commonly, arbitrary positions, (1-6) are used to make it easier to develop plays. <br> <br>
    To begin, each team lines up on the wall their side of half, facing each other. At the discretion of the referee, both team sprint to half, of which the referee will drop the ball as fairly as possible to the nearest wall, allowing the fastest sprinter to gain possession for their team first.  Each team is given 30 seconds from their initial position of the ball to score a goal, only resetting if a shot is taken, or if a player from the opposing team is ejected. Once a goal is scored, the opposite team will take possession of the ball and line up at half-court, of which the referee will start the play at his discretion. A player, without the ball is their possession, is not allowed to go inside the 2 meter marker of the opposing side of half-court.

    <h2>Violence</h2>
    <p>
      Waterpolo is a true contact sport. Unlike other sports, water poloâ€™s only protective gear are ear guards attached to the cap. Other than that sparse protection, players are completely vulnerable. This results in a fair level of violence. Although illegal, generally whatever happens underwater cannot be seen by referees unless specifically being looked for, so it goes unpunished. This results in a sport that is very violent and sometimes excessively brutal. One of the most popular examples of this is the  <a class="ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_in_the_Water_match">Blood in The Water Match</a> in the 1956 Olympics. This match, while being a political icon for the Hungarian Revolution, is also a great example of just how violent the sport can be.
